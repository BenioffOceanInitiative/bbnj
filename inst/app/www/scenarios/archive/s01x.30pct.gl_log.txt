Optimize a model with 44 rows, 98827 columns and 1184967 nonzeros
Variable types: 0 continuous, 98827 integer (98827 binary)
Coefficient statistics:
  Matrix range     [1e+00, 4e+03]
  Objective range  [1e+01, 3e+03]
  Bounds range     [1e+00, 1e+00]
  RHS range        [9e+00, 2e+07]
Presolve removed 0 rows and 7688 columns
Presolve time: 0.07s

Explored 0 nodes (0 simplex iterations) in 0.15 seconds
Thread count was 1 (of 12 available processors)

Solution count 0
